# Lambda Calculus
> An introduction to the Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus is a tiny functional language for expressing computation based 
on function abstraction and application. 

This project is intended to be an educational resource for learning and 
implementing functional programming languages.

**Looking for Lambda Calculator?** It's been moved into it's own repository: https://github.com/sgillespie/lambda-calculator

## Introduction to Lambda Calculus
Introductory material is provided. They can be found at

 * [doc/lambda-calculus.md](doc/lambda-calculus.md)
 * [doc/system-f.md](doc/system-f.md)

### Extended Examples
More examples can be found in the Lambda Calculator's test-suite, located at

 * [test/Language/Lambda/Untyped/Examples](test/Language/Lambda/Untyped/Examples)
 * [test/Language/Lambda/SystemF/Examples](test/Language/Lambda/SystemF/Examples)

## Implementation
A simple implementation of lambda calculus is available at https://github.com/sgillespie/lambda-calculator.
It is intended be used as a companion to the materials here.
